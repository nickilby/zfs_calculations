- **Chassis Cost Integration**: Include server/chassis costs in total calculations
- **Currency Support**: British Pound (¬£) formatting

### üìä **Comparison Tools**
- **Save Configurations**: Save multiple storage configurations for comparison
- **Load & Edit**: Load saved configurations back into the form for modifications
- **Export/Import**: Save comparisons to JSON files for backup and sharing
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses localStorage to maintain comparisons between sessions

### üéØ **User Experience**
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern design with clear visual feedback
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+Enter`: Add current configuration to comparison
  - `Ctrl+Delete`: Clear all comparisons
- **Smooth Animations**: Smooth scrolling and transitions

## Usage

### Basic Calculation
1. **Enter Drive Details**: Drive size (TB), cost per drive, and model
2. **Select Drive Type**: SATA, NVME U.2, NVME U.3, or NVME M.2
3. **Configure Storage**: Number of drives, VDEVs, and RAID type
4. **Add Chassis Cost**: Optional server/chassis cost
5. **View Results**: See raw storage, usable storage, and cost per GB

### Comparison Features
1. **Add to Comparison**: Click "Add to Comparison" to save current configuration
2. **Load Configuration**: Click "Load" on any saved configuration to edit it
3. **Export Data**: Click "Export" to download comparisons as JSON
4. **Import Data**: Click "Import" to load previously exported comparisons

### Supported RAID Types

| Type | Description | Usable Storage |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Mirror** | 2+ drives per VDEV, 1 drive usable | 1 drive per VDEV |
| **RAIDZ** | 3+ drives per VDEV, 1 parity | (drives-1) per VDEV |
| **RAIDZ2** | 4+ drives per VDEV, 2 parity | (drives-2) per VDEV |
| **RAIDZ3** | 5+ drives per VDEV, 3 parity | (drives-3) per VDEV |
| **DRAID1** | Distributed RAID with 1 parity | (drives-1) per VDEV |
| **DRAID2** | Distributed RAID with 2 parity | (drives-2) per VDEV |
| **DRAID3** | Distributed RAID with 3 parity | (drives-3) per VDEV |

## Technical Details

### Storage Calculation Formula
```
Raw Storage = Drive Size √ó Number of Drives
Usable per VDEV = (Drives per VDEV - Parity) √ó Drive Size
Total Usable = Usable per VDEV √ó Number of VDEVs
ZFS Usable = Total Usable √ó 0.8 (20% ZFS overhead)
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Total Drive Cost = Number of Drives √ó Cost per Drive
Total Cost = Total Drive Cost + Chassis Cost
Cost per GB = Total Cost √∑ (ZFS Usable Storage √ó 1024)
```
